#
# This is a Platform SDK non-leaf-node makefile.  It is used to allow NMAKE, 
#  or a similar tool, to recursively build all of the samples in a directory 
#  tree.  To add or remove a directory from the build process, modify the 
#  DIRS list above.  
#
# The SDKPROJ macro (above) is defined solely for the purpose of echoing
#  the current directory location to the screen.  
#
# Do not modify this makefile except for the DIRS and SDKPROJ macros above.
#

#
# Include sdkpropbld.mak in order to get standard build options, environment
#  variables, and macros.  The sdkpropbld.mak file is installed with the SDK 
#  in the include directory.
# 

!include <sdkpropbld.mak>

# 
# In order to build "all," process each of the entries in the DIRS list.
#

#
# In order to build each of the entries in the DIRS list, change dir into the
#  directory in question, echo the current location, run nmake recursively, 
#  and change dir back to the original directory level.  This four step process 
#  is encapsulated in sdkbld.mak which is installed with the SDK in the include
#  directory.
